# Interstellar Adventure

**Website**: [Interstellar Adventure](https://intersteller-blond.vercel.app/)

A web-based adventure that combines space exploration with education. Currently, only the frontend is deployed; the backend will be deployed later.

## Overview

- Players assume the role of astronauts, navigating the solar system to collect samples while using strategic planning due to limited resources.
- Built with React and Express, the game features a seamless interface and real-time data from NASA, making each mission informative and engaging.
- Through challenges and exploration, Interstellar turns the vastness of space into an interactive learning playground, inviting users to discover the wonders of the universe while strategically managing their journey through the cosmos.

## Key Features

- **Educational Content with NASA Data**: Accurate, real-time astronomical information enriches the exploration of planets like Earth, Mars, and Venus.
- **React and Express Integration**: A dynamic user interface crafted with React, backed by server-side logic through Express for robust application performance.
- **Custom-Built API and Advanced Web Technologies**: Tailored API providing specific astronomical data, with the application leveraging BrowserRouter, axios, and React hooks for seamless navigation and efficient data management.
- **Scalable Game Design**: Potential to add more planets and spaceship attributes, enhancing the game's playability and complexity.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:

2. **Run the Development Server**:

3. **Gameplay Instructions**:
    - **Play Background Music**: Click the play button at the top right corner to enjoy background music for a better experience.
    - **Enter Spaceship Parameters**: Enter the spaceship's distance and shield strength, which will affect how far your spaceship can travel.
    - **Explore Planets**: Click the small planet buttons on the panel at the bottom to check each planet's data. Each planet has its distance from Earth and surface temperature.
        - **Spaceship Shield Strength**: The higher or lower the planet's surface temperature, the higher the required spaceship shield strength.
        - **Spaceship Distance**: The distance your spaceship can travel will affect which planets you can reach. Note that the distance calculation includes the round trip.
    - **Collect Samples**: On each planet, collect different samples.
    - **Future Features**: Currently, only single-planet jumps are implemented. Future updates will include multi-planet jumps where collected samples will earn points, forming a complete path-based game.
